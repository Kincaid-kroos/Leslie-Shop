    </h4>
       <p><strong className="font-bold text-[#f3e2e2]">1. Do you allow multiple access to one account?</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Yes, we do allow several users to use one account.</li>
       </ul>
       <p><strong className="font-bold text-[#f3e2e2]">2. How long does it take for the customer agent to reply?</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>The service is on first come first serve basis.</li>
       </ul>
       <p><strong className="font-bold text-[#f3e2e2]">3. What happens to a locked account?</strong></p>
         <ul>
           <li>We pass a locked account to a new user. By doing this, we solve two problems. First, our service will be used only by professionals, for whom this is an everyday work and who earn with it and stay active every day. Second, we mix the users. As a result, the client uses one profile and then another one. It will be impossible to track down such a user, especially if they pay in Bitcoin.</li>
         </ul>
         <p><strong className="font-bold text-[#f3e2e2]">4. What about appropriate behavior?</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li>It is strongly recommended to be polite while communicating on ICQ or jabber because we are initially willing to do our best to help the client. Failing to do so will force us to take harsh actions. Also, avoid writing private jabber/ICQ messages to the administration without a serious reason. If you have any questions, write an email.</li>
